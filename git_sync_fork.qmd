- Do a `git rebase` on your main branch of your local fork


## 2. Using the Command Line

```bash
# Set the upstream repo of the fork -- To do only once
git remote add upstream https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/bren-eds213-data.git

# Check it was added to remotes
git remote -v

# Optional: Switch to your main branch if you were working on a branch
git checkout main 

# Pull all the latest commits from the main repo (upstream) 
git rebase upstream main 
git push origin main
```
