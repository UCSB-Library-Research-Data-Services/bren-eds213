## DuckDB Installation

DuckDB has been installed on the MEDS server. We also recommend to install it on your personal machine following those instructions.

### MacOS

We recommend to use homebrew to install DuckDb on a Mac:

```bash
brew install duckdb
```


### Windows

1.  Download the latest version from <https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/>

2.  Create a `DuckDB` folder inside `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local` ![](img/duckdb-windows_folder.png)

3.  Unzip the duckdb_xx_zip you just downloaded inside that folder (this should put `duckdb.exe` in this folder)

4.  Add this folder to your path `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local`

    a.  Open System Properties by pressing the Windows key on your keyboard and searching for "environment variables"
    b.  Access Environment Variables: In the System Properties window, go to the "Advanced" tab. Click on the "Environment Variables" button. Edit the PATH Variable: In the Environment Variables window, you will see two sections: User variables and System variables. Select the "Path" variable under the User section. Click the "Edit" button
    c.  Add New Path: In the Edit Environment Variable window, click the "New" button. Type the full directory path of the program you want to add. Press "Enter" to confirm the path.

    d.  Save Changes: Click "Ok" in the Edit Environment Variable window. Click "Ok" in the Environment Variables window. Click "Ok" in the System Properties window.
    e.  Restart your machine

## Visual code integration

You can use DuckDB directly from the terminal but if you also want to have the option to have both a SQL script and the terminal open, we recommend to use visual code. There is one setting to be done to link the script and the terminal:

Under the main VS menu, go to *Settings* -\> Keyboard Shortcuts, search for "run selected", the "run selected text in active terminal" will be one of the options. Set the shift-enter keypress by double-clicking. Right-click on the *When* column, select *Change When Expression*, and add `editorLangId == 'sql'` to restrict to just SQL files and not every kind of file.

*Now you can hit* <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> at then end of a line in your SQL script and it should run the command directly in the terminal!

## Test

Let's test our new installation using **Visual Studio Code**:

1.  open a terminal from the *terminal* menu -\> *new terminal*

2.  In the terminal type `duckdb`, this will start `duckdb` (your prompt in the terminal should now be a `D`)

3.  Open a New text file: *file* menu -\> *new text file*

4.  Copy paste the following code:

``` sql
-- Start the DB at the terminal: duckdb

CREATE TABLE ducks AS SELECT 3 As age, 'mandarin' AS breed;

SHOW TABLES;

FROM ducks SELECT *;
```

5.  Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> to run the SQL code line by line

You should have something that looks like this:
