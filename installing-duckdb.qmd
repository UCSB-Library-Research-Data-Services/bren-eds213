title: "Installing duckDB"
---


## Installation

DuckDB has been installed on the MEDS server. We also recommend to install it on your personal machine following those instructions: https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/


## Visual code integration (optional)

You can use DuckDB directly from the terminal but if you also want to have the option to have both a SQL script and the terminal open, we recommend to use visual code. There is one setting to be done to link the script and the terminal:

In Visual Code:

- open the palette <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and search for: `Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)` ![](img/duckdb-vscode_setup.png)

- enter the following text & save
```json
// Place your key bindings in this file to override the defaults
[
    {
        "key": "shift+enter",
        "command": "workbench.action.terminal.runSelectedText"
    }
]

```

*Now you can hit <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> at then end of a line in your SQL script and it should run the command directly in the terminal!*

## Test

Let's test our new installation using visual code

1. open a terminal from the _terminal menu -> new terminal_

2. In the terminal type `duckdb`, this should start duckdb

3. Open a New text file: _file menu -> new text file_

4. Copy paste the following code: 

```sql
-- Start the DB at the terminal: duckdb

CREATE TABLE ducks AS SELECT 3 As age, 'mandarin' AS breed;

SHOW TABLES;

FROM ducks SELECT *;
```

5. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> to run the SQL code line by line

You should have something that looks like this:
