title: "Installing duckDB"
---


## Installation

DuckDB has been installed on the MEDS server. We also recommend to install it on your personal machine following those instructions: <https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/>


## Visual code integration (optional)

You can use DuckDB directly from the terminal but if you also want to have the option to have both a SQL script and the terminal open, we recommend to use visual code. There is one setting to be done to link the script and the terminal:

Under the main VS menu, go to _Settings_ -> Keyboard Shortcuts, search for "run selected", the "run selected text in active terminal" will be one of the options.  Set the shift-enter keypress by double-clicking.  Right-click on the _When_ column, select _Change When Expression_, and add `editorLangId == 'sql'` to restrict to just SQL files and not every kind of file.

*Now you can hit <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> at then end of a line in your SQL script and it should run the command directly in the terminal!*

## Test

Let's test our new installation using **Visual Studio Code**:

1. open a terminal from the _terminal_ menu -> _new terminal_

2. In the terminal type `duckdb`, this will start `duckdb` (your prompt in the terminal should now be a `D`)

3. Open a New text file: _file_ menu -> _new text file_

4. Copy paste the following code: 

```sql
-- Start the DB at the terminal: duckdb

CREATE TABLE ducks AS SELECT 3 As age, 'mandarin' AS breed;

SHOW TABLES;

FROM ducks SELECT *;
```

5. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> to run the SQL code line by line

You should have something that looks like this:
