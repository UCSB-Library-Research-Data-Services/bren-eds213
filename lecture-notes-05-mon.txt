DATA MANAGEMENT STATEMENTS
- INSERT: already seen that
- UPDATE table SET ... WHERE ...
- DELETE FROM table WHERE ...
- caution: these operate on whole tables if unqualified
- strategies to avoid catastrophes
-- just subconsciouly be careful, like holding a kitchen knife
-- put comment in front: -- DELETE FROM ..., then remove comment
-- do SELECT first, then replace SELECT with DELETE <- allows inspection
   of what's about to be deleted
-- tweak table name, put x in front, then remove

I/O
- all RDBMSs have scriptable I/O tools
- generally, INSERT one at a time is slow
- output to CSV
-- .mode csv, .headers on, .output file
-- plain .output to turn output off
- loading CSVs: see build script
- if table doesn't exist, is created w/ all text columns (don't skip header)
