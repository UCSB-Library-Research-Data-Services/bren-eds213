title: "Week 9 - How FAIR is your data set?"
---


Using the [FAIR Assessment tool](FAIR_assessment_tool.qmd){target="_blank"}, evaluate the FAIRness of the two following data sets:

1. [Ephemeral wetland macroinvertebrate communities of the Great Plains](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3Ad544dff2-319a-4753-a1f1-48b6e1413285)
2. [Insect functional traits on arable land, Finland 2020](https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/view/doi%3A10.5063%2FF11N7ZK5)
3. Which one would you prefer to reuse?

#### Notes:

- Please add narrative justification to explain your choices done using the FAIR assessment tool
- There are several data sets in the first data deposit, assess all the files at once using the worst case/file for your evaluation, but discuss variability in your justification
