## Relationship between egg volume and time of the year

One might wonder if egg volumes would be larger during warmer months. We don't have much data to work with using our database example, but we can leverage measurements for the months of June and July hypothesizing that July is warmer than June.  

Our ask:

- Develop an SQL query to compute a table with the average egg volume per month (June & July) at each site  (20pt)

- Use you favorite programming language (R or Python) to create a plot (choosing the type of plot you think is the most appropriate) of average egg volume differences between June and July (in percentage)  and try to answer the question about influence of temperature on egg volume  (10pt)
