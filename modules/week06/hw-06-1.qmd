For the purposes of this problem you may assume that at some point the school's system performs the query

```         
SELECT *
    FROM Students
    WHERE (name = '%s' AND year = 2024);
```

where a student's name, as input by a user of the system, is directly substituted for the `%s`. Explain exactly how Little Bobby Tables' "name" can cause a catastrophe. Also, explain why his name has two dashes (`--`) at the end.

## Bonus problem!

Hack your bird database! Let's imagine that your Shiny application, in response to user input, executes the query

```         
SELECT * FROM Species WHERE Code = '%s';
```

where a species code (supplied by the application user) is directly substituted for the query's `%s` using Python interpolation. For example, an innocent user might input "wolv". Craft an input that a devious user could use to:

-   Add Taylor Swift to the Personnel table
-   Yet *still* return the results of the query `SELECT * FROM Species WHERE Code = 'wolv'` (devious!)
