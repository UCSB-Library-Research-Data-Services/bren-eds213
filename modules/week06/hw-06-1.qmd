For the purposes of this problem you may assume that at some point the school's software performs the query

```         
SELECT *
    FROM Students
    WHERE (name = '%s' AND year = 2023);
```

where the student's name is directly substituted for the `%s`. Explain exactly how Little Bobby Tables' "name" can cause a catastrophe. Also, explain what happens to the `' AND year = 2023);` part of the query.

## Bonus problem!

Hack your bird database! Let's imagine that your Shiny application, in response to user input, executes the query

```         
SELECT * FROM Species WHERE Code = '%s';
```

where a code is directly substited into the query's `%s` using Python interpolation. For example, the user might input "barr". Craft an input that will:

-   Add Taylor Swift to the Personnel table
-   *Still* return the results of the query `SELECT * FROM Species Code = 'barr'`
