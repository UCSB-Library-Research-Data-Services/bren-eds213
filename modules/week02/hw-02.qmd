title: "Week 2 - Data Cleaning"
---

**Please use Canvas to return the assignments: <https://ucsb.instructure.com/courses/19301/assignments/238393>**

We cleaned the Snow_cover column during class. Inspiring yourself from the steps we followed, do the following in a quarto document:

1. Clean the `Water_cover` column to transform it into the correct data type and respect expectations for a percentage

2. Clean the `Land_cover` column to transform it into the correct data type and respect expectations for a percentage

3. Use the relationship between the three cover columns (Snow, Water, Land) to infer missing values where possible and recompute the `Total_cover` column

**Add comments on your quarto document about your decisions and assumptions**, this will be part of the grading.


### Setup

You should start a new quarto document named `eds213_data_cleaning_assign_YOURNAME.qmd` in your fork of the GitHub repository [bren-meds213-data-cleaning](https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/bren-meds213-data-cleaning).


### The expectations are:

- The qmd should run and
- Output a csv file named `all_cover_fixed_YOURNAME.csv` in the `data/processed` folder


### On Canvas:

- Add the URL to your fork on GitHub in the Website URL

- Upload the qmd & csv files to Canvas
