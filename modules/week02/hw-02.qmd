title: "Week 2 - Data Cleaning"

**Please use Canvas to return the assignments: <>{target="_blank"}**

We cleaned the `Snow_cover` column during class. Inspiring yourself from the steps we followed, do the following in a quarto document:

1. Clean the `Water_cover` column to transform it into the correct data type and respect expectations for a percentage

2. Clean the `Land_cover` column to transform it into the correct data type and respect expectations for a percentage

3. Use the relationship between the three cover columns (Snow, Water, Land) to infer missing values where possible and recompute the `Total_cover` column as needed

**Add comments to your quarto document about your decisions and assumptions**, this will be part of the grading.


### Setup

You should start a new quarto document named `eds213_data_cleaning_assign_YOURNAME.qmd` on **your fork** of the GitHub repository [bren-meds213-data-cleaning](https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/bren-meds213-data-cleaning). Don't forget to use the [metadata](https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/bren-meds213-data-cleaning/blob/main/data/raw/01_ASDN_Readme.txt) present in the data folder


### The expectations are:

- The Quarto document `eds213_data_cleaning_assign_YOURNAME.qmd` should run if your repo is cloned locally
- The code should output a csv file named `all_cover_fixed_YOURNAME.csv` in the `data/processed` folder
- Your quarto document should have all the necessary explanations about the decisions you made and potential assumptions you used (don't forget to look at the metadata!)


**Note**: We recommend starting by importing the csv file with the corrected `Snow_cover` column (`data/processed/snow_cover.csv`) we generated during class (my code [here](https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/bren-meds213-data-cleaning/blob/later/data-cleaning.qmd))

### How to submit your assignment to Canvas:

- Add the URL of your repository at the top of your repo's README

- Download your repository as a `.zip` file and upload it to canvas
