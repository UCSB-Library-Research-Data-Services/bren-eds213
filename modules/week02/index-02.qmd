## Cleaning the raw data

The original shorebird data set has been collected over many years by many different researchers. It is thus prone to have some data quality issues. Before we can ingest our data into our database, we will have to implement some data cleaning on the csv files to make sure we do not loose information during the import due to the constraints we can impose on the database. And in any case, the `garbage in, garbage out` motto often use in modeling applies here as well!

Here is the repository where we are going to practice our data wranglers skills, **PLEASE CREATE A FORK and clone your fork to your machine**:

## Analyzing the data from the csv files

Now that we have cleaned some of the tables, let's try to conduct some data analyses to start exploring the data set. **PLEASE CREATE A FORK and clone your fork to your machine**:
