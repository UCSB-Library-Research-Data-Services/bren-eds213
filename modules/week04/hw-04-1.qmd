title: "Week 4 - Missing data"

Which sites have **no** egg data? Please answer this question using all three techniques demonstrated in class. In doing so, you will need to work with the Bird_eggs table, the Site table, or both. As a reminder, the techniques are:

-   Using a `Code NOT IN (subquery)` clause.

-   Using an outer join with a `WHERE` clause that selects the desired rows. Caution: make sure your `IS NULL` test is performed against a column that is not ordinarily allowed to be NULL. You may want to consult the [database schema](https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/bren-meds213-spring-2024-class-data/blob/main/week3/schema-build-script.sql) to remind yourself of column declarations.

-   Using the set operation `EXCEPT`.

Add an `ORDER BY` clause to your queries so that all three produce the exact same result:

```         
┌─────────┐
│  Code   │
│ varchar │
├─────────┤
│ barr    │
│ burn    │
│ bylo    │
│ cakr    │
│ cari    │
│ chau    │
│ coat    │
│ colv    │
│ iglo    │
│ ikpi    │
│ lkri    │
│ made    │
│ nome    │
│ prba    │
├─────────┤
│ 14 rows │
└─────────┘
```
