title: "Week 7 - Capstone project README.md"
---

Total Points: 50

Instructions:

Each capstone project group must submit a README file in Markdown (.md) format that thoroughly documents the datasets used or produced in the project. You can customize this [README Template](https://zenodo.org/records/10828379) as needed to fit the specifics of your project.
For datasets with shared characteristics (e.g., similar file formats, variables, or units such as images or time series data), you may streamline the documentation by describing shared features once. 
If your group, your client, or the original data source adopted a metadata standard, you must acknowledge this in the README and briefly describe the standard used.

Submission details are available on Canvas.
